### 📔 Functional Foundations: A Mathematical & Practical guide

| Chapter | Title | Key Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **I** | **Introduction to Mathematical Functions** | Basic definition of functions, Domains & Codomains, Mapping concepts to Python/Haskell functions, and an early introduction to Category Theory (Objects, Morphisms, Categories). |
| **II** | **The Calculus of Functions**  | Lambda Calculus, Bound vs. Free variables, Alpha-conversion, Beta-reduction, and Haskell equivalents. |
| **III** | **The Functional Paradigm**  | Declarative vs. Imperative programming, Pure functions, Side effects, Referential Transparency, and contrasting Python with pure Haskell. |
| **IV** | **First-Class Citizens**  | Higher-order functions, Anonymous functions (`lambda`), Function closures in Python and Haskell. |
| **V** | **Data Transformation**  | Functional primitives: `map()`, `filter()`, and the reduction of sequences with `reduce()`/`fold`. |
| **VI** | **Iteration & Recursion**  | Avoiding loops, Recursion depth, Python's `itertools` for infinite sequences, and lazy evaluation in Haskell. |
| **VII** | **Category Theory for Coders**  | Functors and the "M-word" (Monads) in a programming context. |
| **VIII** | **The Pythonic Functional Toolbelt**  | Using `functools` (partial, lru_cache) and List/Dict/Set Comprehensions, and how they relate to Haskell's syntax. |
| **IX** | **Immutability & State**  | Persistent data structures and managing "state" without changing variables in multi-paradigm vs. pure functional environments. |

*Note: Throughout the textbook, pure functional concepts will be demonstrated using Haskell snippets alongside Python code to cleanly illustrate the differences between a multi-paradigm approach and a strictly pure functional approach.*

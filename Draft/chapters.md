### 📔 Functional Foundations: A Mathematical & Practical guide

| Chapter | Title | Key Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **I** | **The Calculus of Functions**  | Lambda Calculus (), Bound vs. Free variables, Alpha-conversion, and Beta-reduction. |
| **II** | **The Functional Paradigm**  | Declarative vs. Imperative programming, Pure functions, Side effects, and Referential Transparency. |
| **III** | **First-Class Citizens**  | Higher-order functions in Python, Anonymous functions (`lambda`), and Function closures. |
| **IV** | **Data Transformation**  | Functional primitives: `map()`, `filter()`, and the reduction of sequences with `reduce()`. |
| **V** | **Iteration & Recursion**  | Avoiding loops, Recursion depth, and Python's `itertools` for infinite sequences. |
| **VI** | **Category Theory for Coders**  | Basic concepts of Categories, Functors, and the "M-word" (Monads) in a programming context. |
| **VII** | **The Pythonic Functional Toolbelt**  | Using `functools` (partial, lru_cache) and List/Dict/Set Comprehensions. |
| **VIII** | **Immutability & State**  | Persistent data structures and managing "state" without changing variables. |

      This is a project to create a Text book with Latex 
      The textbook is about functional programming and category theory.
      The target audience is high school students but the content covers advanced researcher label topics. 
      The main pourpose is to understand the category theory and functional programming.
      The textbook is written in English. 
      Throughout the book, exaple codes snipet written in Python.
      This book is a programming book and mathematical book at the same time. To explain the theory, we use python code. 
      To understand the category theory behind the concept is the goal.
      The textbook is written in Latex.
      The draft plan as a table of contents has been prepared in Draft/chapters.md.
